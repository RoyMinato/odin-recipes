# odin-recipes
Basic recipe website project to apply HTML knowledge into a simple project.

Purpose of this project is to display basic HTML that I've learned
over the past few days. For now, this project will only use HTML as
I plan on learning CSS and JavaScript next and then incorporating them later.

Final result is viewable on GitHub Pages: https://royminato.github.io/odin-recipes/
